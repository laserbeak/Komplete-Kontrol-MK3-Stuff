![IMG_0747](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a7fbd5d-c618-47b0-859e-7da8adc3e216)

This is an early, quick and dirty template for the OPSIX Module and SE versions.
As of now, it has Volume, Glide, Algorithm and Opertor controls mapped on a single page.
Bonus: PANIC! button.
Modifications to come. Have some? Please share!
